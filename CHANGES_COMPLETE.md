- Calculates reference levels from **09:45-10:00 AM** (instead of 10:00-10:15)
- Selects strikes at **10:00 AM** (instead of 10:15)
- Starts trading from **10:00 AM** onwards (instead of 10:15)

## Critical Fix: Candle Filtering Logic

### Problem Identified
The candle aggregator's `get_candles()` method had incorrect end_time filtering:
```python
# OLD (WRONG):
if end_time and candle_time > end_time:
    continue
```

This would **include** the candle at end_time, which is incorrect.

### Example of the Problem
When requesting candles from 09:45 to 10:00:
- ✓ 09:45 candle (09:45:00-09:49:59) - INCLUDED
- ✓ 09:50 candle (09:50:00-09:54:59) - INCLUDED
- ✓ 09:55 candle (09:55:00-09:59:59) - INCLUDED
- ✗ 10:00 candle (10:00:00-10:04:59) - **INCORRECTLY INCLUDED**

The 10:00 candle contains data from 10:00:00 onwards, which should NOT be in the 09:45-10:00 reference window.

### Solution Implemented
```python
# NEW (CORRECT):
if end_time and candle_time >= end_time:
    continue
```

Now when requesting candles from 09:45 to 10:00:
- ✓ 09:45 candle (09:45:00-09:49:59) - INCLUDED
- ✓ 09:50 candle (09:50:00-09:54:59) - INCLUDED
- ✓ 09:55 candle (09:55:00-09:59:59) - INCLUDED
- ✓ 10:00 candle (10:00:00-10:04:59) - **CORRECTLY EXCLUDED**

This ensures the reference window contains exactly 15 minutes of data (three 5-minute candles).

## Candle Timestamp Logic Explained

### How Candles Work
Candles use the **start time** of the period as their timestamp:

| Candle Timestamp | Data Period | Completes At |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 09:45 | 09:45:00 - 09:49:59 | 09:50:00 |
| 09:50 | 09:50:00 - 09:54:59 | 09:55:00 |
| 09:55 | 09:55:00 - 09:59:59 | 10:00:00 |
| 10:00 | 10:00:00 - 10:04:59 | 10:05:00 |
| 10:05 | 10:05:00 - 10:09:59 | 10:10:00 |
| 10:10 | 10:10:00 - 10:14:59 | 10:15:00 |

### Reference Level Calculation
At 10:00 AM, when we request candles from 09:45 to 10:00:
- We get: 09:45, 09:50, 09:55 candles
- Total: 15 minutes of data (09:45:00 to 09:59:59)
- This is used to calculate RN, GN, BN

### Entry Signal Detection
At 10:10 AM, when checking for entry:
- **Previous candle:** 10:00 (data from 10:00:00-10:04:59)
- **Current candle:** 10:05 (data from 10:05:00-10:09:59)

For CALL entry, we check:
1. 10:00 candle close > RN ✓
2. 10:05 candle close > RN ✓
3. 10:05 close > 10:00 close ✓

If all conditions met → Enter CALL

## New Trading Timeline

### 09:15 AM - Market Opens
- Bot starts
- WebSocket connects
- Tick data collection begins

### 09:45 AM - Reference Window Starts
- Bot begins collecting data for reference levels
- Aggregates 1-minute candles

### 10:00 AM - Reference Calculation & Strike Selection
**Step 1:** Calculate reference levels
- Fetch candles from 09:45-10:00 (three 5-min candles)
- RN = High of period
- GN = Low of period
- BN = (RN + GN) / 2

**Step 2:** Select strikes
- Get current Nifty spot price
- CALL strike = Spot + 200
- PUT strike = Spot - 200

**Step 3:** Subscribe to options
- Add option tokens to WebSocket

**Step 4:** Fetch historical option data
- Get option data from 09:45-10:00
- Recalculate reference levels with actual option prices

**Step 5:** Open trading window
- Bot is now armed and ready for entries

### 10:00+ AM - Trading Window
- Monitor Nifty 5-minute candles
- Look for two-candle confirmation patterns
- First possible entry: 10:05 AM (more likely 10:10 AM)

### 15:15 PM - Hard Exit
- Force exit any open positions

### 15:30 PM - Market Close
- Bot can be stopped

## Testing Checklist

### Before Market Open
- [ ] Run `python download_instruments.py`
- [ ] Verify KiteConnect access token is valid
- [ ] Check `.env` configuration:
  - TRADING_PHASE=2
  - REFERENCE_WINDOW_START=09:45
  - REFERENCE_WINDOW_END=10:00
  - STRIKE_SELECTION_TIME=10:00

### During Trading
- [ ] Verify reference levels calculated at 10:00 AM
- [ ] Verify strikes selected at 10:00 AM
- [ ] Verify trading window opens at 10:00 AM
- [ ] Monitor for entry signals from 10:05 AM onwards
- [ ] Check candle timestamps in logs

### Log Messages to Watch For
```
⏰ Calculating reference levels from 09:45-10:00 candles...
✅ Reference levels calculated
🎯 Selecting strikes at 10:00...
✅ Strikes selected
Trading window opened (>= 10:00) and armed.
✅ CALL confirmed: prev_close=X > RN=Y, curr_close=Z > RN and > prev_close
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Configuration
```bash
grep -E "REFERENCE_WINDOW|STRIKE_SELECTION" .env
```

Expected output:
```
REFERENCE_WINDOW_START=09:45
REFERENCE_WINDOW_END=10:00
STRIKE_SELECTION_TIME=10:00
```

### Check Code Changes
```bash
# Verify breakout logic
grep "_trade_start_time" strategy/breakout_logic.py

# Verify main.py timing
grep "09:45\|10:00" main.py

# Verify candle filtering
grep -A 5 "Check end time" utils/candle_aggregator.py
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to old timing (10:00-10:15):

1. Edit `.env`:
```bash
REFERENCE_WINDOW_START=10:00
REFERENCE_WINDOW_END=10:15
STRIKE_SELECTION_TIME=10:15
```

2. Edit `strategy/breakout_logic.py`:
```python
self._trade_start_time: time = time(10, 15)
```

3. Restart bot

## Important Notes

1. **Candle filtering fix is critical** - Without it, reference levels would include data from 10:00:00 onwards, which is outside the intended window.

2. **First entry timing** - The earliest possible entry is 10:05 AM, but more realistically it will be 10:10 AM or later (requires two consecutive candles meeting criteria).

3. **Re-entry logic** - After exit, the bot requires price to move back to opposite side of breakout level before allowing new entries.

4. **Paper trading mode** - Bot is in Phase 2, so all trades are logged but no real orders are placed.

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the logs in `logs/trading.log`
2. Verify timestamps in log messages
3. Ensure candles are being aggregated correctly
4. Check that reference levels are calculated at 10:00 AM sharp

All changes are complete and ready for live market testing! 🚀
